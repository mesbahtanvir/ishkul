# ============================================
# NOTE: Environment Variable Management
# ============================================
#
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# The .env file in this directory is used by godotenv for local development.
# This file is NOT committed to Git (.gitignore excludes it).
#
# PRODUCTION (Cloud Run):
# All environment variables are synced via GitHub Actions:
# 1. Set each variable as a GitHub Secret in your repository
# 2. GitHub Actions automatically passes them to Cloud Run during deployment
# 3. No manual ./scripts/update-backend-env.sh needed!
#
# To add a new variable:
# 1. Add it here with a placeholder: NEW_VAR=value
# 2. Add to GitHub Secrets: https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/ishkul/settings/secrets/actions
# 3. Update .github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml to include the new secret
#
# Special handling:
# - JWT_SECRET: Automatically managed in Google Secret Manager (set once, not updated)
# - Variables starting with underscore (_): Treated as secrets
# - All others: Applied as regular environment variables
