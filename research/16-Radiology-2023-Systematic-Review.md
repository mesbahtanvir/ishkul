## Abstract

### Purpose
Radiology is a highly complex field that requires mastery over an ever-expanding body of knowledge. Spaced learning, interleaving, and retrieval practice are evidence-based learning strategies that enhance long-term retention of information. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of these interventions in the setting of radiology education.

### Methods
- Searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, ERIC, and forward/backward citations
- Search period: database inception to February 19, 2023
- Eligibility: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials investigating spaced, interleaved, or retrieval practice on knowledge retention related to medical imaging

### Results
- Of 1,316 records reviewed, 8 studies met eligibility criteria
- 2 studies investigated spaced learning
- 2 studies investigated interleaving
- 6 studies investigated retrieval practice (2 combined spaced learning + retrieval)
- 5 of 8 studies reported statistically significant differences

### Conclusions
Despite extensive evidence supporting spaced, interleaved, and retrieval practice in broader literature, few studies examine these strategies specifically in radiology education. Additional trials are needed.

## Key Findings

1. **Mixed Results:** Learning science strategies don't automatically transfer to specialized domains
2. **Implementation Matters:** Context and delivery method affect outcomes
3. **Research Gap:** More domain-specific studies needed for complex professional fields
4. **Promising but Cautious:** Evidence supports these techniques but implementation requires care

## Relevance to Ishkul

This paper provides a cautionary note: while spacing, interleaving, and retrieval practice are well-supported in general education research, their application to specialized domains requires careful implementation and evaluation. For Ishkul, this suggests:

- Don't assume learning techniques transfer perfectly across all subjects
- Monitor effectiveness and adjust algorithms based on actual user outcomes
- Consider domain-specific factors when designing practice schedules
- Collect data to evaluate what works in different learning contexts
