## Key Themes for Ishkul

1. **Retrieval Practice** - Testing/quizzing enhances learning more than restudying
2. **Spaced Repetition** - Distributing practice over time dramatically improves retention
3. **Interleaving** - Mixing problem types helps learners discriminate and transfer
4. **Self-Explanation** - Prompting learners to explain "why" deepens understanding
5. **Metacognition** - Training students in effective strategies requires addressing beliefs and habits

## How These Inform Ishkul

- **Quiz Generation** - Leverage retrieval practice/testing effect
- **Scheduling Algorithm** - Use spaced repetition models (DAS3H, optimal scheduling)
- **Problem Mixing** - Interleave different concepts in practice sessions
- **Explanation Prompts** - Include self-explanation cues in lessons
- **Learning Strategy Tips** - Help users understand why these methods work
