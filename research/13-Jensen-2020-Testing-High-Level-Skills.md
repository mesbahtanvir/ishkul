## Abstract Summary

The testing effect is one of the strongest learning techniques documented to date. While the effects of testing on high-level learning are promising, fewer studies have examined this phenomenon. This classroom study investigated:

1. Whether a testing effect exists for high-level (Bloom's taxonomy) test items
2. Whether higher-level testing affects low-level content retention
3. Whether content knowledge, cognitive skill, or additional components drive this effect

## Key Findings

- Confirmed a testing effect on high-level cognitive items
- Higher-level skills (scientific reasoning) are correlated with biology achievement
- The high-level testing effect is due to better ability to apply specific skills to specific content when this application process appeared on a previous exam
- Testing enhances not just factual recall but also problem-solving and application abilities

## Relevance to Ishkul

This paper supports including higher-order questions (analysis, application, evaluation) in Ishkul's quiz generation, not just factual recall questions. Testing should challenge learners at multiple cognitive levels for optimal learning outcomes.
